Description: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a bank marketing dataset to identify factors influencing customer subscription to term deposits. Built predictive models using machine learning to enhance campaign targeting, leading to increased subscription rates. The project included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning. Usability testing was conducted at each stage of model development to assess prediction accuracy.

Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge was managing the class imbalance in the dataset, as most clients did not subscribe. This was addressed by applying oversampling techniques to balance the data and improve model training outcomes. Additionally, feature selection required careful evaluation to maintain model interpretability without sacrificing performance.

Results:
The final Random Forest model achieved a 93.6% accuracy rate, significantly improving prediction reliability. Key insights from the analysis helped the client refine their marketing approach, contributing to a 20% increase in campaign efficiency.
